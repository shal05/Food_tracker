# Food_tracker

Intro

This is food tracking web app I built using the Flask framework which allows one to keep track of their diet and accomplish their fitness goals!
The App allows you to enter the food items you eat throughout the day - nutrients including: Protein, Carbs, Fat and the calories you have consumed. You are able to save this into the database within the app. You may update your entries as you please. On top of this, you can set goals for yourself in those nutrient categories and try to hit those goals throughout the day.

Requirements

Please check the requirements.txt file for what software you will need up to date to clone this onto your environment.

Technologies

Project implemetes a RESTful API in CRUD which sends and recieves GET/POST requests from the HTTP server. This is done by using Flask which acts as the app's backend. Flask creates the different site routes to allow functionality in adding, updating, deleting food requests as well as the goals.

The app's frontend is developed in HTML, CSS and JS - ensuring a responsive design so it is compatiable on all device types and easy to use.
